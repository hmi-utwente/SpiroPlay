# SpiroPlay
A suite-of-games breathing game app for children with asthma, including fault detection. 

The code starts from the point we have gathered the realtime flow data from a handheld spirometer device (through a dedicated app/SDK which we can't release).  
11 metaphors are included. 

Adaptations and use of (parts of) the software is allowed with appropriate attribution (right license will be chosen upon release). 
For research this includes a clear reference to our first paper.
