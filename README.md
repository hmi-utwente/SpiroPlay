SpiroPlay
A suite-of-games breathing game app for children with asthma, including a first rule-based version for fault detection. For instructions of use see https://youtu.be/MSPVP-FCaYc.

The projects starts from the point we have gathered the realtime flow data from a handheld spirometer device (through our own middleware which we can't release). The expected stream contains a flow per 10-ish ms. Various handheld spirometer devices can deliver such a stream, although it is important to have both measures for inhalation and exhalation.

11 metaphors are included.
